🛑 You do NOT need useEffect when:

✅ 1. Handling local events (like button clicks)
jsx
Copy
Edit
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>
Just use onClick, onChange, etc. No need for useEffect.

✅ 2. Showing/hiding UI based on state
jsx
Copy
Edit
{isVisible && <div>Hello!</div>}
You can just change state, no useEffect required.

✅ 3. Passing props and rendering something with them
jsx
Copy
Edit
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
}
No side effects — just display based on props? Skip useEffect.

✅ 4. Calculating something from state or props (inside render)
jsx
Copy
Edit
const doubled = count * 2;
You don’t need useEffect to compute values. Just calculate in the body.

✅ 5. Styling or conditionally applying class names
jsx
Copy
Edit
<div className={isActive ? 'on' : 'off'}>Light</div>
No side effects — just styling logic? No need for useEffect.

🧠 Rule of thumb:
❗ Only use useEffect when you want to run code after React renders something, like:

Fetching data

Listening to events outside JSX (window, document)

Setting timers

Interacting with third-party libraries

Manually changing DOM (rare in React)
